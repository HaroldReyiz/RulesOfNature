///   Author: Martin "quill18" Glaude (quill18@quill18.com)

///	  Modified slightly (mostly code reformatting) by Burak Canik for use on game "RulesOfNature".
///	  Also renamed PoolsManager.

///   UPDATES:
///     2018-01-04: - Added Extension Method for Despawn on GameObjects 
///                 - Changed the Member Lookup so it doesn't require a PoolMemberComponent anymore.
///                     - for that i added a HashSet which contains all PoolMemberIDs  (HashSet has O(1) contains operator)
///                     - PoolMemberIDs are just ints from GameObject.getInstanceID() which are unique for the GameObject 
///                        over the runtime of the game
///                 - Changed PoolDictionary from (Prefab, Pool) to (int, Pool) using Prefab.GetInstanceID
/// 	2015-04-16: Changed Pool to use a Stack generic.
/// 
/// Usage:
/// 
///   There's no need to do any special setup of any kind.
/// 
///   Instead of calling Instantiate(), use this:
///       SimplePool.Spawn(somePrefab, somePosition, someRotation);
/// 
///   Instead of destroying an object, use this:
///       SimplePool.Despawn(myGameObject);
///   or this:
///       myGameObject.Despawn();
/// 
///   If desired, you can preload the pool with a number of instances:
///       SimplePool.Preload(somePrefab, 20);
/// 
/// Remember that Awake and Start will only ever be called on the first instantiation
/// and that member variables won't be reset automatically.  You should reset your
/// object yourself after calling Spawn().  (i.e. You'll have to do things like set
/// the object's HPs to max, reset animation states, etc...)
///
